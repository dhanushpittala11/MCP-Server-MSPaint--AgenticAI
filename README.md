# MCP_Server_Client_MSPaint_AgenticAI
The MS Paint Application doesn't have API for the MCP Server to Access and connect it to the MCP Client. So, with the help of prompt, this program is designed such that the the MS Paint App is accessed through an MCP server and connected to the MCP Client automatically, without the use of any functional tool calls. 
Prompting is the Key in this project. The prompt is designed in such a way that LLM can call the paint tool through MCP Client Automatically, without the use of any manual
function tools.
